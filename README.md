Small project to work with SIM7020E. 
Right now I'm developing in a STM32 board, but I'm trying to isolate the STM HAL library from my application software.
I'm using the STM32CuBe IDE. I havent done the Cmake to compile it externally yet.
It's possible that I develop a firmware to other devices than just the modem, like a GNSS or IMU module.
